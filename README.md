Idea:
* Our idea is to analyze Eurovision Song Contest data, over several years, in order to prove or disprove the following hypotheses.

Hypotheses:
- Hypothesis 1: There is a correlation between the running order (R/O) and the final result. Performing later tends to be associated with a better final result.
- Hypothesis 2: Contestants who perform in the last third of the show receive higher average scores than those performing in the first third of the show.
- Hypothesis 3: Slot 2 is often referred to as the “death slot” as no contestant performing at this position has ever won a final, and consistently rank lower than other positions, so a song performing second will perform worse in the final result than it would otherwise.
- Hypothesis 4: Voting patterns differ between juries and the televote in regards to the running order. The televote appears more influenced by when a song is performed compared to the juries.
